pixivsort

1. Description:
    This script searches through two given directories (SOURCE and DESTINATION).
    All files and directories in SOURCE which match a specific naming convention
    are moved to directories in DESTINATION which also match a naming convention.
    
    The naming conventions for SOURCE and DESTINATION are currently hardcoded in
    main.py. They are regular expressions matching the following names:
    SOURCE:
        (<artist id>) <artist> - <title>.<extension>
        or for directories:
        (<artist id>) <artist> - <title>
    DESTINATION:
        <artist> (<artist id>)
        
    If you wish to use different naming conventions please change those two
    regular expressions.
    
2. Execution
    To run the script, start main.py with source and destination paths:
    
    python pixivsort.py /path/to/source /path/to/destination
